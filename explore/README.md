# explore

This is the template for the `explore` page. This is where users can swipe through user profiles and get matches.

## contribute

This page is using vue. Make sure the `dist/` directory is not ignored when contributing. Until a custom action is configured, we will be running `npm run build` and pushing changes to this directory to the repo. The demo mobile app will be rendering the following url: `https://justuslesbigay.github.io/demo-pages/explore/dist/`

It will be rendered with a fixed height of `675px`
